# Project is published at https://euluna.github.io/tester/

<del>
The project is published at https://euluna.github.io/tester/, but the "Add to Task" functionality will not work because we did not get verification to use the Google Tasks API on a published project. It is still in the testing phase, so we can only approve specific accounts for access.

<del>
To test the full functionality:

Config File:

- Please contact Euluna at ega48@sfu.ca to get the config.js file, which includes the working API keys.

Google Accounts for Testing:

- Since the API is still in the testing phase and not yet verified for publishing, please provide the Google accounts you plan to use so I can grant them access.

Run Locally:

- Use a local server to run the project.
- Open the command prompt (cmd), navigate to the projectâ€™s file location, and run:
  python -m http.server 8000
- Access the application via your browser at:
  http://localhost:8000/
  </del>
