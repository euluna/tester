The "Add to Task" functionality will not work because we did not get verification to use the Google Tasks API on a published project. It is still in the testing phase, so we can only manually approve specific accounts for access. Please contact Euluna at ega@sfu.ca and provide me with your google accounts so that I can grant them access.
